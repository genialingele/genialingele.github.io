            <p> For graphic design and video editing, 
                I have more than 5 years of commercial experience with 
                Adobe: Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and more than 5 years with WordPress.
                I believe satisfyingly that I can change the way we do business in Africa.
                I want to bring our country up to international standards and even better.
